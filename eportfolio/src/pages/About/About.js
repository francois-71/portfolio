        <p className="description">
          I am a dynamic young professional with a passion for technology and
          innovation. My journey into the world of IT and software development
          began during my academic pursuits, where I honed my skills in web and
          software development. While I've recently graduated, I've already had
          the opportunity to contribute to significant projects in software and
          web development, including a transformative internship that led to a
          full-time role as a Python DevOps Developer at Devoteam Innovative
          Tech.
